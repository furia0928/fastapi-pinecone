    The vector database stores the official API documentation for both LangChain and LangGraph.
    When a user asks questions related to LangChain or LangGraph, this vector database is utilized
    to provide relevant and accurate official API information.
    Internally, the "search_vectors" function is used to perform the vector search.

      summary: Execute vector search
      description: >
        Converts a text query into an embedding, performs a vector search within a specified namespace,
        and returns up to **20** matching vectors with their ID, score, and metadata.
        If there are fewer than 20 relevant results, it will return only the available matches.
        The search is performed on the vector database containing the official APIs for LangChain and LangGraph.
